        <h2>The Importance of Security in Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          In today's digital age, securing web applications is paramount. With
          the rise of data breaches and cyber attacks, ensuring the safety and
          integrity of user data is a responsibility that developers must take
          seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js, provides
          robust tools and best practices for securing your applications.
          Combined with secure database practices, you can build applications
          that protect user data and maintain trust.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Database Security Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Databases are the backbone of modern web applications, storing
          everything from user credentials to sensitive information. Without
          proper security measures, databases can be vulnerable to attacks such
          as SQL injection, data leaks, and unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <p>
          By implementing security best practices, such as using prepared
          statements, encrypting sensitive data, and regularly updating database
          software, you can mitigate risks and ensure the confidentiality,
          integrity, and availability of your data.
        </p>
